## How to use

### Run HeadStart frontend
Install the project using `npm install`.

To start the project, use the `npm run dev` command.

There are two options available. You can either add the CaaS and Navigation Services credentials in the form located at http://localhost:3000, or you can open the link within the
ContentCreator, where the credentials will be automatically populated.

### HeadStart in ContentCreator

#### Server Configuration

Ensure the **CaaS Connect WebApp** is added to the ContentCreator WebApp - a prerequisite for establishing the connection to CaaS and Navigation Services.
